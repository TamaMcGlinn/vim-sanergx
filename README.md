Tired of `gx` not working correctly (see [issue #4738](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/4738)) I
decided to take all that is useful from vim's ancient netrw, and the result is ten lines of code.

This works much better than netrw.

To install use any vim plugin manager:

    % git clone https://github.com/felipec/vim-sanegx.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/sanegx
